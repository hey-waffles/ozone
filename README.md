# Ozone
My personal startpage, tooling, app center, and security center.

## TODO
### Environment Setup
Things to do before we get too deep into development

 - Implement server typescript
 - Development daemon for server for auto-refreshing
 - Create either a symlink or shared directory for ts configuration
   - I have precisely no idea how to make this work with docker :/
 - Typescript rules
 - Implement ESLint? 

### Minimum Viable Product
What we need to get done before we can submodule this in our composify

 - Production version of server
 - Production version of frontend
 - /app/\[key\] pages, with hard-coded handling for dev-ozone, portainer, octopi, and reroll
 - A homepage that *doesn't* look like garbage :p
 - Google sign in (my email only)
 - MySQL connection
 - Base styling (material-ui)

### Future Features
 - Adding/editing apps
 - Startpage functionality
 - Automatic tests
