## TODO

Things to do before we get too deep into development

Ready to go! :D

### Minimum Viable Product
What we need to get done before we can submodule this in our composify

 - Production version of server
 - Production version of frontend
 - /app/\[key\] pages, with hard-coded handling for dev-ozone, portainer, octopi, and reroll
 - A homepage that *doesn't* look like garbage :p
 - Google sign in (my email only)
 - MySQL connection
 - Base styling (material-ui)

### Future Features
